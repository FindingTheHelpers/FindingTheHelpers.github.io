<p>A team of Football players help sophomore Chy Johnson deal with
her bullying problems at school by becoming her friend. <!-- more --></p>

<p>From parts of the <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/8579599/chy-johnson-boys">ESPN article</a> on this story:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d come home every night at the start of the school year
crying and upset,&rdquo; says her mom, Liz Johnson. &ldquo;That permanent
smile she had, that gleam in her eye, that was all gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her mom says she tried to talk to teachers and administrators
and got nowhere. So she tried a whole new path &mdash; the starting
quarterback of the undefeated football team. After all, senior
Carson Jones had once escorted Chy to the Special Olympics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just keep your ear to the ground,&rdquo; Liz wrote to Carson on his
Facebook page. &ldquo;Maybe get me some names?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Carson Jones did something better than that. Instead of ratting other kids out, he decided to take one in &mdash; Chy.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>I get emailed stories like this a lot, but most of the time
they don&rsquo;t pan out. They turn out to be half true, or true
for the first week but not the second. But when I walked
into the Queen Creek High School cafeteria Tuesday,
unannounced, there was 4-foot-high Chy with 11 senior
football players, eating her lunch around the most packed
lunch table you&rsquo;ve ever seen, grinning like it was
Christmas morning. It was Carson&rsquo;s birthday, and she&rsquo;d made
him a four-page card. On one page she wrote, in big crayon
letters, &ldquo;LUCKY GIRL.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Krishnan was an award-winning chef with Taj Hotels, Bangalore and was short-listed for an elite job in Switzerland. After witnessing a distressing incident in 2002, he quit his job and began feeding the homeless and mentally disabled in his hometown. He said, &ldquo;I saw a very old man, literally eating his own human waste out of hunger. I went to the nearby hotel and asked them what was available. They had idli, which I bought and gave to the old man. Believe me, I had never seen a person eating so fast, ever. As he ate the food, his eyes were filled with tears. Those were the tears of happiness.&rdquo;</p>
